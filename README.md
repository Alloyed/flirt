Flirt
=====

Flirt is a small script for picking the appropriate version of LOVE to
use for any given LOVE game. To run flirt, you'll need a vanilla lua
install and a unix-like environment with the following commands:

* unzip
* which
* test
* mkdir

This means no Windows, sorry.

Using
-----

Flirt can be installed using luarocks:

```
# luarocks install https://fix.me/flirt.rockspec
```

Or you can use a compiled, single-file version if you prefer:

```
$ wget https://fix.me/flirt_script -O ~/bin/flirt && chmod +x ~/bin/flirt
```

Then, we need to tell flirt where our LOVE installs are:

```
$ flirt --autoconf # will look for common names
$ flirt --add-exe `which love` # You can also manually specify paths
```

Then, we can just use flirt instead of using our love binaries directly:

```
$ flirt my_game.love
$ alias love=flirt
$ love my_game_dir
```

If a game does not specify a version, flirt will use the most recently
released version of LOVE you have told it about, ignoring pre-release
builds. If you do not have an appropriate version of LOVE installed,
flirt will tell you what version the game expects and fail.
